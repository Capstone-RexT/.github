## Hi there üëã

### Team Introduction
We are Team16 RexT from Ewha Womans University, working on innovative projects to enhance security in satellite networks. Our team consists of:
- **Í≥ΩÌòÑÏ†ï**: Project manager, model architecture exploration, and Llama model implementation.
- **Í∞ïÌò∏ÏÑ±**: Fingerprinting model design and implementation.
- **ÌôçÏßÄÏö∞**: Network vulnerability analysis, traffic analysis, and Fingerprinting model design and implementation.

### Current Project: Starprint
Our current project, **Starprint**, aims to prevent privacy leaks through satellite internet hacking by utilizing Website Fingerprinting techniques to analyze security vulnerabilities in the Starlink network. This project contributes both academically and practically to the enhancement of satellite network security.

### Project Overview
- **Project Duration**: 2024-2025
- **Main Goals**:
  1. Analyze Starlink satellite network traffic patterns.
  2. Apply Website Fingerprinting techniques to verify security vulnerabilities and privacy exposure in Starlink.
  3. Propose new security solutions and protocols for satellite internet, including Starlink.

### Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Data Preprocessing**: Torch
- **Model Training**: Keras

### Expected Outcomes
- Identify specific vulnerabilities in satellite networks to contribute to related security research.
- Provide directions for enhancing Starlink's security based on data-driven analysis.
